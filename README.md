## 🚀 About Me

With over 9 years of professional experience, I specialize in backend software development and DevOps. My career has taken me from hands-on coding and mentoring at ecx.io (an IBM Company), to architectural leadership at Rinels and Digacon, impactful microservices work at Infobip, and independent consulting with Path Variable LLC. I’ve also contributed as a Full Stack Engineer at TripAdvisor, and currently drive backend innovation as a Senior Software Engineer at Revolut, focusing on expansion into new markets.

I am passionate about sharing knowledge and engaging with the tech community through public speaking. I have delivered talks at renowned industry events, including two sessions at JavaCro 2024, a presentation at the London Java Community Meetups in February and a talk at Open South Code 2025 this June. I am excited to speak at DevConf in Lodz, Poland in early October. My talks focus on a range of software engineering topics, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning, community involvement, and advancing best practices in the field.
